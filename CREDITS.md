Map Generator (OpenSimplex Noise):

 * OpenSimplex Noise in Java. by Kurt Spencer
 *
 * v1.1 (October 5, 2014) - Added 2D and 4D implementations. - Proper gradient
 * sets for all dimensions, from a dimensionally-generalizable scheme with an
 * actual rhyme and reason behind it. - Removed default permutation array in
 * favor of default seed. - Changed seed-based constructor to be independent of
 * any particular randomization library, so results will be the same when ported
 * to other languages.
